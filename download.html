                    <h3>PIXLEMON</h3>
                    <p>Pixelmon Generations is a Pokémon mod you can apply to Minecraft to transform the game into a pixelated Pokémon paradise. You’ll find Pokémon roaming the many biomes on your journey from the likes of Bulbasaur to Ditto that you can
                        catch, tame, and fight with. Pixelmon is a Pokémon-inspired world in Minecraft, so you’ll still be able to visit shops, gyms, and centers as you would in Pokémon.</p>
                    <p>If you want to combine your favourite games, then here’s how to get the Minecraft Pokémon mod, including how to download Pixelmon Generations, and a full list of all the console commands for the best experience.</p>

                    <p>LeagueOfGamers adds the ability to talk to your friends through Minecraft & Discord, simply Join a Voice Channel On Discord After Linking Your Minecraft Account With Discord.It Will Automatic Drag You Guys To A Different Voice Room
                        On Discord is undoubtedly the quickest way to convey a message, useful in combat, social and general interactions. My favorite feature is the semi-realistic voice chat, in short, only players near you can hear/talk to you, it's
                        called distance based voice chat.</p>
